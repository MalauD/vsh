# vsh
A blazingly fast shell made in Rust ðŸ¦€

</div>

This is a shell made for the sophisticated power user. Far from finished yet but the main motive is to create a hyperextensible shell with all the features of previous generations added with tools geared towards improving workflows.

## Installation

Copy and paste the following command and choose the appropriate installation method for you. You can remove the `install.py` file afterwards
```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vaimer9/vsh/main/install.py
python3 install.py
```


## Customization
Once you run vsh for the first time it automatically creates `.vshrc.toml`.
All the customization possible is written there.
Even then here is the text
```toml
[prompt]

double = false
color = [115, 147, 179]
text_color = [33, 33, 33]
promptchar = "Î»"
style = "classic"

[misc]
alias = [
	["", ""]
]
```


### Example Config file
This is the config file personally used by me:
```toml
[prompt]
style = "Modern"
color = [33, 33, 33]
text_color = [115, 147, 179]
double = false
```
As you can see customizing is not that hard and doesn't require too much code. I will be adding more and more into the level of customization possible!
