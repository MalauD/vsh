# vsh
A Blazingly fast shell made in Rust ðŸ¦€

</div>

## IMPORTANT
Until Jan 10 any major commits won't be there as I will be having my exams and probably won't be able to find the time to sit down and implement new features. 

I will be doing minor commits like bugfixes, responding to issues and reviewing PRs so no need to worry about the project going cold. 
Although after 10 Jan I plan to make a new repo containing `vsh` scripting language's parser.

## Installation

Copy and paste the following command and choose the appropriate installtion method for you. You can remove the `install.py` file afterwards
```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vaimer9/vsh/main/install.py
python3 install.py
```
## About

### Why make another shell?

[Nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/) which is the current leading rust shell, is very opinionated. It brings a lot to the table for someone who just wants a shell but in rust. Namely, a new `ls` command, new scripting experiece etc. What is missing is just bash written in rust and vsh is here to deliver that. The planned scripting language will be a interchangable with bash and all of its features so that people don't feel *homesick* or dropped into a new space when they start using vsh. As the for shell prompt I plan to expand upon it to add plugins to accept a wide array of custom plugins all written in vsh. Till then feel free to contribute yourself!

## Customization

To customize your prompt you have to edit the `.vshrc.json` file in your home directory.
The file is created when you first open `vsh`.
When initialized the file contains an emtpy json object, i.e:
```
{

}
```
### Themes
There are two themes with the following properties
- Classic: `double: boolean value` and `character: string value`.
- Modern: `double: boolean value`, `character: string value`, `color: List with 3 elements`, `text_color: List with 3 elements`

### Double
**defualt value:** `False` 

Determines wether the prompt will be double lined or single lined
eg:
```json
{
	"double": "false"
}
```
Keep in mind that you have to enter `true` or `false` as string i.e inside double quotes

### Character
**default value**: `Î»`

The character that you will have in the starting of the prompt.
### Color
**default**: `[109, 152, 134]`

Determines background color of modern shell prompt. Eg:
```json
{
	"color": [255, 255, 255]
}
```
### Text Color
**default**: `[33, 33, 33]`

Determines text color of modern shell prompt. Eg:
```json
{
	"color": [255, 255, 255]
}
```
### Example Config file
This is the config file personally used by me:
```json
{
	"style": "modern",
	"color": [115, 147, 179]
}
```
As you can see customizing is not that hard and doesn't require too much code. I will be adding more and more into the level of customization possible!
